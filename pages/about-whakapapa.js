                    Whakapapa Foundation is a Non Profit Organisation registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act 2013 and is operational since 2021. It was founded by two college friends Kharthickeyen and Abinaya who wanted to support the coach and the kids after seeing their genuine passion and need for help.

                    The name <b>Whakapapa</b> is borrowed from the MƒÅori culture where it is defined as the genealogical descent of all living things from the creation of the universe to the present time. It is a fundamental principle in Maori culture where one recites their Whakapapa to proclaim their ancestry and connect themselves with their roots while placing themself in a wider context, linking themself back to the land, sea, sky and universe. Whakapapa resonated with our values as it essentially means to appreciate one&apos;s roots while understanding that we are all the same sharing our ancestry to nature and the universe.

                    We are thankful to Mr. Saud Amin Khan, the former director of Whakapapa Foundation for trusting in our cause, values, and purpose and transferring the Section 8 company to us. It helped give structure to our efforts in the form of an NGO.

                        Together with GS Boxing Club we are helping children from underprivileged backgrounds to get better opportunities at life through this sport of Amateur Boxing. We aim to ensure that these kids get better employment and higher education opportunities through the sports quota while leading a disciplined athlete life free from drug and alcohol abuse. Thus we empower them to earn a livelihood for themselves through a sport that they are naturally good at. We believe that such sports-based empowerment could bring a greater change in underprivileged sections of society. We further wish to take up causes that help empower people and the planet.
